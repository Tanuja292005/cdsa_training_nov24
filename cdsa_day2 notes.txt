day2 notes update:

Data types:
1.char size-1 byte
2.int size-4 bytes
3.double size-8 bytes
Note: By default these data are signed MSB is signed bit
4.float size-4 bytes(by default 6digits of precision)

Manipulators:
1.one that change sign(signed,unsigned)
2.one that changes size(short,long)
Note: By default int is long int
thus int is long int and also signed long int
short int is 2 bytes
long int is 8 bytes

Keywords:
   for, while, do(loops)
   switch, case, default(to implement choosing between options)
   if, else(to implement binary conditions)
   break(to control out of the block)to skip remaining instructions of current iteration and continue with interation
   return(to return the caller.Alternatively we can return the value also)
   struct, union, enum(to create user defined data types)
   static(to create a global variable with file scope and to cfeate a local variable with life till end of the program)
   void(to mention that the function does not return the value)
   extern(to use an external variable[global variable in some other file])
   const(to create read only variable[const variable])

Operators:
1.Arithmetic they are + - * / %
2.Binary(requires 2 operands 0 & 1)
3.Input number
4.Output number
Evaluated from left to right(left to right associated) 
Ex: in x+y-z, x is evaluated first
+ and - operators have lesser priority
The associtivity is overwritten by precidence of operators
Ex: in x-y%z, y%z is evaluated first
In every operation data types of the operands must be same
Infix notation is used
The evaluation of any arithmetic expression written in infix notation is first converted into postfix and then evaluated
5.Relational
